# What is Ceph?
Ceph stands for Cephalopod and is an open-source software platform designed to abstract hardware for block, file, and object storage. It provides a unified storage solution that can scale horizontally.

## Why Use Ceph?
- **Scalability:** Easily scales out by adding more nodes without downtime.
- **Reliability:** High availability and fault tolerance through data replication.
- **Open Source:** Community-driven development and no vendor lock-in.

## Ceph Components
- **Ceph Monitor (MON):** 
  - Maintains the cluster map and state.
  - Ensures consistency among monitors, crucial for overall cluster health and coordination.

- **Ceph Manager (MGR):** 
  - Works alongside MONs to provide real-time monitoring and metrics.
  - Hosts management through modular plugins like dashboards and Prometheus exporters.

- **Ceph Object Storage Daemon (OSD):** 
  - Handles actual data storage, replication, recovery, backfilling, and rebalancing.
  - Acts as the core worker nodes of the Ceph cluster.

- **Ceph Metadata Server (MDS):** 
  - Manages metadata for Ceph File Storage (CephFS).
  - Enables efficient file operations such as directory listing and file permissions.

- **Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW):** 
  - Acts as a RESTful gateway that provides S3 and Swift-compatible object storage APIs on top of RADOS.

- **Ceph Orchestrator:** 
  - Integrates with external tools like CephADM, Rook, or DeepSea.
  - Automates deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management of Ceph daemons.
  - Enables declarative cluster management, simplifying operations via CLI or dashboard interface.

## Ceph Architecture Overview
- Clients interact with Ceph via:
  - **CephFS** for File Storage.
  - **RBD** (RADOS Block Device) for Block Storage.
  - **RGW** for Object Storage.

- Data is stored as objects in the RADOS cluster.
- The **CRUSH** algorithm determines data placement, ensuring no single point of failure.

## CRUSH Algorithm
- **CRUSH** stands for Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing.
- Determines how data is distributed across OSDs.
- Eliminates the need for a central lookup table.
- Facilitates scalability and fault tolerance.

## Monitoring and Management
- **Ceph Dashboard:**
  - A web-based interface for cluster management.

- **Ceph CLI:**
  - Command-line tool for administration.

- **MGR Modules:**
  - Extend functionality with plugins (e.g., Prometheus, Zabbix).

## Getting Started with Ceph
1. **Review Hardware and OS Recommendations:** Ensure your hardware meets the requirements for optimal performance.
2. **Set Up MONs, MGRs, and OSDs:** Deploy the necessary components to establish the cluster.
3. **Deploy CephFS, RBD, or RGW as Needed:** Choose the appropriate storage interface based on your use case.
4. **Utilize Ceph Dashboard for Monitoring:** Leverage the dashboard for real-time insights into cluster health and performance.
